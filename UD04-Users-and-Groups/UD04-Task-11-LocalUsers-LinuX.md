## Script 06

Code a Shell Script that let the user chosing between the next paths:

- `/root/`

- `/var/`

And after that, shows all the users on the systems which their $HOME are in the selected path.

## Script 07

# The continuum improving

## Script 09 

Code a Shell Script that uses the first argument to indicat if the script must list *users* or *groups*. If the first parameter is :
`user`, then the script must take the **second** argument as the *username* and list all the groups of the user given. If the first parameter is : `group`, then the script will use the **second** argument as a *groupname* and list all the users on this group.

Examples of execution:
```shell
usuario@maquina:~$./script-09.sh user tic
 * The groups of the user tic will be displayed:
tic adm sudo
```

```shell
usuario@maquina:~$./script-09.sh group sudo
 * The user of the group sudo will be displayed:
tic
aberlanas
```

## Script 10

Using the script of the task 09 as a base for development make the next improvements (next exercises uses the same base):

- Test that the number of arguments is three or show an error message and exit with error : `exit 1`

## Script 11

Improve the script 10 :

- Test if the user or the group are valid (exists on the system) before execute the commands.
  
## Script 12 

Improve the script 11 :

- Show each group or user from the listed items in separate lines.

```shell
usuario@maquina:~$./script-09.sh user tic
 * The groups of the user tic will be displayed:
tic 
adm 
sudo
```

## Script 13

Improve the script 12:

If the user is member of the group `sudo`, display a message in the same line indicating the `Super-Cow Powers`

```shell
usuario@maquina:~$./script-09.sh user tic
 * The groups of the user tic will be displayed:
tic 
adm 
sudo -> IS A SUPER USER! 
```

## Script 14

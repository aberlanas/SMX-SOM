# Task 01

Using the info available in Aules about **Identity and Access Management in Windows Systems** (yes, the *390 pages document*), at page 37 (and following pages) : *local accounts*, you can find information about Users Creation and differences between the kind of users.

Read carefully until *Security considerations* (included) and answer in English the next questions:

## Question 01

What is the meaning of the expression: *built-in accounts*. 

## Question 02

In which process is the System Administrator account created?

## Question 03

Launch the MMC Console about Users and Groups and make an ScreenShot. 

## Question 04

The default Administrator can be deleted? What mechanism is provided in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 in order to improve the System Security.

## Question 05

Why is a good idea limiting the users in the Administrators group. *Explain with a real World Example*.

## Question 06

What is the attribute of the Administrator account that never changes and could be used by *malicious* users?.

## Draft

In order to improve our english writing skills, make a draft (>= 200 words) about the parallelism between the Security considerations part (document) and the *sudo* mechanism in GNU/LinuX systems.

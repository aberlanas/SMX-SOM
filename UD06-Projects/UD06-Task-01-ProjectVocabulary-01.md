# Customer's Interview

You have a new client! Tomorrow, he will come to your enterprise in order to demand a VirtualMachine with an OS plus several apps and configurations installed on it.

We have no idea about his projects, and we don't have any clue about the purpose of the VirtualMachine.

Write in good english, several questions to be answered by him.

And prepare a brief presentation about yourself for the interview.

Take notes about his requeriments and next week prepare all the stuff for him. We need the client!



PD: A lo largo de mañana y el viernes iré entrevistándome con cada uno (yo soy el cliente). Apuntad todo lo que os pida, la entrevista será toda en Inglés.

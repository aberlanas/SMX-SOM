   FIFA 20: Defensive Tactics
   
   Each formation has default settings across three key areas which you can 
   amend to better suit your playing style. Defensive Style, Width and Depth 
   can all be changed to help you alter the formation to make it suit your 
   players and the way you intend to play FIFA 20.

   There are five options for Defensive Style: Drop Back, Balanced, Pressure on Heavy Touch, 
   Press After Possession Loss and Constant Pressure. 
   
   These are ordered by the levels of pressure your players put 
   on the opponents when you do not have possession.

   *Drop Back* attempts to keep your formation shape when you lose the 
   ball and players will stick to their positions unless you manually 
   control them to move them out of position. Constant Pressure is the exact 
   opposite to this and has players harry the opposition to try to win the 
   ball back at the earliest opportunity, with every player pressing including 
   strikers and wingers. This can often move players out of position 
   and causes players to tire more quickly.

   Balanced is a mix of the two and is the default setting for every formation. 
   Pressure on Heavy Touch puts the pressure on when there is a loose 
   ball or when a player controls the ball poorly, while Press After 
   Possession Loss will have all your players press for seven seconds 
   after losing the ball before reverting to Balanced.

   Defensive Width has three main options: Narrow, Normal and Wide, 
   but is applied using a 1-10 scale. Narrow (1-3) keeps your players 
   in the middle of the field, congesting the central areas but leaving 
   space out wide. Normal (4-7) attempts to be balanced, maintaining 
   the default shape of the formation, while Wide (8-10) covers the wings 
   more and stop opponents exploiting wide areas.

  Zombies

  A zombie cooperation mode, titled "Zombies", is included in the game. Originally featured in World at War, 
  it was revamped to be included in Black Ops. It is a four-player online and two-player split screen co-op mode (which can also be unlocked online).

  *"Five"*

  "Five" takes place in The Pentagon during a chain of events that differ from the storyline of the campaign mode.
  The playable characters, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro are interrupted from negotiations 
  by an outbreak of zombies. "Five" has many hidden secrets, from an 'Easter Egg' song, which Treyarch's Zombies are famous for 
  (in the case of "Five", the Easter Egg song is 'Won't Back Down' by Eminem and featuring P!nk). 
  There are also hints of connections between "Five" and the first DLC zombies map in the Black Ops season pass, Ascension through hidden radios throughout the map.

  *Kino Der Toten*

  Kino Der Toten takes place in an abandoned Group 935 facility located within a theater in Berlin, 
  and takes place in 1965. The words "Kino Der Toten" mean "Cinema of the Dead" in German, 
  though the in-game character, Edward Richtofen, translates it as "Theater of the Damned" 
  in the loading screen pre-game. 
  The map features a single teleporter pad, as well as several hidden references to other maps, 
  both past and future. By activating various meteor pieces throughout the map, 
  players can hear an Easter Egg song, "115" written by Kevin Sherwood, and sung by Elena Seigman,
  who is the lead singer in many of Treyarch Sound's songs. 
  The playable characters in this map return from the World at War Zombies mode. 
  Edward Richtofen, a mad German scientist from the World War Two era, Takeo Masaki, 
  the last of the Japanese Samurai, Nikolai Belinski, a WWII era Soviet soldier, and Tank Dempsey, 
  a Marine from the United States are teleported to Kino Der Toten from the last map of World at War, Der Riese.

  Phases
  *Pre-Game phase*

  Players start in the "Pre-Game Phase", where they're put on the Spawn 
  Island that acts as the lobby while they wait. Players can openly roam 
  the island and pick up and test fire weapons. Matches won't begin until 
  the lobby is near full, and once there, the Battle Bus starts its engines and honks. 
  A 10-second countdown timer then begins, after which all players are loaded 
  onto the Battle Bus and it takes off to the game map. Players are now in the "Bus Phase".

  *Bus Phase*

  The Battle Bus chooses a random trajectory across the world map, flying 
  at a steady speed in a straight line until it fully crosses the mainland. 
  There's a 5-second countdown shortly after takeoff, and once the timer expires, 
  players enter the "Drop Phase". 

  *Drop Phase*

  During this phase, players choose when to exit the bus to skydive/glide to the ground; 
  players who remain on the bus when it reaches its destination are forced off. 
  The Battle Bus departs from the island. Once the Drop Phase begins, 
  a 35-second countdown timer (depends on the length of route), after which the Storm warning sounds. 
  Players enter a 1-minute grace period before the Storm begins to form. Once the time is up, 
  a white circle appears on the map, showing players where the storm eye will stop shrinking first. 
  Players can see the storm beginning to form around the outside of the map.

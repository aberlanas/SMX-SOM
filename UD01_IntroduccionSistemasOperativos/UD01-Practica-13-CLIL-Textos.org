   FIFA 20: Defensive Tactics
   
   Each formation has default settings across three key areas which you can 
   amend to better suit your playing style. Defensive Style, Width and Depth 
   can all be changed to help you alter the formation to make it suit your 
   players and the way you intend to play FIFA 20.

   There are five options for Defensive Style: Drop Back, Balanced, Pressure on Heavy Touch, 
   Press After Possession Loss and Constant Pressure. 
   
   These are ordered by the levels of pressure your players put 
   on the opponents when you do not have possession.

   *Drop Back* attempts to keep your formation shape when you lose the 
   ball and players will stick to their positions unless you manually 
   control them to move them out of position. Constant Pressure is the exact 
   opposite to this and has players harry the opposition to try to win the 
   ball back at the earliest opportunity, with every player pressing including 
   strikers and wingers. This can often move players out of position 
   and causes players to tire more quickly.

   Balanced is a mix of the two and is the default setting for every formation. 
   Pressure on Heavy Touch puts the pressure on when there is a loose 
   ball or when a player controls the ball poorly, while Press After 
   Possession Loss will have all your players press for seven seconds 
   after losing the ball before reverting to Balanced.

   Defensive Width has three main options: Narrow, Normal and Wide, 
   but is applied using a 1-10 scale. Narrow (1-3) keeps your players 
   in the middle of the field, congesting the central areas but leaving 
   space out wide. Normal (4-7) attempts to be balanced, maintaining 
   the default shape of the formation, while Wide (8-10) covers the wings 
   more and stop opponents exploiting wide areas.

All of these tasks must be answered in English.

# Task 01

Using the `mount` command, mount the *iso* content from a Ubuntu Image File (or Windows Image File). Try to create a folder or a file in the mounted filesystem. What happens? Explain it in your own words.

# Task 02

Using the `mount` command, mount the *iso* content from a Ubuntu Image File (or Windows Image File). Now use the `mount` command whithout arguments. Can you see the new "**mountpoint**"? What are the filesystem used in order to access the iso contents?. 

# Task 03

In our Japan IT Enterprise called : **A Most Dangerous Time**, we have a very special client that needs a guide for a totally noob person that explains HOWTO access a *Secret Documents* hidden in a ISO file, from the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Download from Aules the iso file which name is "`amdt.iso`" and create a guide in english (with screenshots) that explains each step.
